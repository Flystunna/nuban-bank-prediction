# NUBAN Bank Prediction Algorithm

This utility function is designed to predict or identify the bank associated with a given Nigeria Uniform Bank Account Number (NUBAN). 

It validates NUBAN account numbers and provides possible banks that could own the account number.

This implementation is based on the Central Bank of Nigeria's [REVISED STANDARDS ON NIGERIA UNIFORM BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER (NUBAN) SCHEME FOR DEPOSIT MONEY BANKS (DMBs) AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (OFIs) IN NIGERIA - MAR 2020](https://www.cbn.gov.ng/out/2020/psmd/revised%20standards%20on%20nigeria%20uniform%20bank%20account%20number%20(nuban)%20for%20banks%20and%20other%20financial%20institutions%20.pdf).
